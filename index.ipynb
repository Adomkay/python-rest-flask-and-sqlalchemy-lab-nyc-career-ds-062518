    "In this lab we are going to practice working with creating a RESTful API that returns data about Tweets and Users. In this domain Users will have many Tweets and Tweets will, therefore, belong to a User. We will be using SQL Alechemy to make our schema and database with which to persist our data. Then we will define RESTful routes and functions that Query our database and return JSON data for each resource. Let's get started!"

We then went further and defined routes that would return information specific to the relation ship between a Tweet and a User and vice versa. By creating an API like this, we can see that it becomes much easier to leverage this information across other applications as well as our own."
